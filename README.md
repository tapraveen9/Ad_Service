Setting up the demo<br>
1) Pre-requirements<br>
a)  Operating system , Windows xp and above<br>
b) Java 1.8 run time environment(make sure jre is setup in the system path as java home)<br>
c) Web server (preferably Apache Tomcat 9)


2) SET Up<br>
a) Download AdService.zip<br>
b) Unzip it in a directory of your choice<br>
c) AdServiceServer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war is the project war file , please deploy it appropriately on a web server. Below is the reference to a guide to install tomcat 9 and deploy an web application<br>
(https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/deployer-howto.html) <br>
d) Alternatively AdServiceServer folder is an eclipse project. You can import the project in the eclipse as maven dynamic web project , include tomcat as server and run it from eclipse. Depending on convenience either C) or D) should be done , not both<br>
e) In the unzipped directory , please open config.properties file and change the host name to the host name of the deployed application on your web server (default entry hostname=default in the properties file , takes http://localhost:8080/AdServiceServer as the value)<br>

f) In the directory , you will additionally find three files POST.txt , GET.txt , GETALL.txt . Please rename them POST.bat , GET.bat , GETALL.bat respectively<br>
g) Open cmd.exe and CD to the unzipped directory<br>

To create an ad please use command POST.BAT as shown below<br>




To retrieve ad based on partnerId please use GET.BAT as shown below<br>


To retrieve all existing ads , please use GETALL as shown below<br>




Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of your persistence mechanism.
            The current implementation uses Map as data store for persistence
                    Advantages:<br>
a) Easy to implement<br>
b) Faster access there by faster response time to the requests<br>
c) No complex underlying calls that cause overhead unlike a relational database<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
a) Data lost when the server restarts.so the actual notion of persistence is not met<br>
b) As the map is in memory , data storage is very limited<br>
c) Transaction mechanism is complex to implement as the data model grows and number of the requests grow<br>
d) Big hindrance to the scalability of the application<br>

Add a URL to return a list of all campaigns as JSON.
      GETALL specified above covers this scenario
Add support for multiple ad campaigns per partner
      	Can be implemented with minimal effort. Couldnâ€™t implement it due to time constraint
